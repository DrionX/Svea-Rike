Rules of using the github:

1.
always attempt to make all new additions to lists of things like country tags or traits should be written afte a line of ##########
Example(from country_tags):

GER	= "countries/Germany.txt"
ENG = "countries/United Kingdom.txt"
SOV = "countries/Soviet Union.txt"
SWE	= "countries/Sweden.txt"
FRA	= "countries/France.txt"
....                              //more countries
MAN = "countries/Manchukou.txt"
###############                   //from here on all countries are new additions
PRS = "countries/Prussia.txt"
HES = "countries/Duchy of Hesse.txt"

2.
never upload to the main branch unleass you are Drion,to make a change work on a seperate branch and we will merge later.
